Random Tempo Generating ChucK Metronome for miniAudicle

When I am practicing something technical and am nearing that magic stage where I think I can actually play the damned thing I have often wished that I had someone doing something for me like what I do for my students: randomly change the metronome tempo around within a defined range without me knowing what it is.  So, this morning I wrote this little ChucK program for miniAudicle.  

Go here: http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/

Install.

Open.

Start Virtual Machine.

Open the ck file from this repository.

Set your minimum tempo, set your maximum tempo.  

Click Next Tempo.  (Note, moving the inicator slider does nothing, I can't find a way to disable this in miniAudicle)

Each click will give you a different random tempo in your chosen range.  

Practice, practice, practice.
